Submission of Tip Calculator App for CodePath

For the completion of this exercise, I followed the tutorial video linked in the instructions. 
Afterwards, I added a settings page, which has the default tip percentage as the only setting. 
I also added a function which updates the tip calculator page whenever the value of the total
bill changes or whenever the main page appears. The fourth section for tipping percentages will
always be the default value.

Issues raised:
I plan on adding more features, but that may not be possible with my finals schedule and the
fact that the only apple computers with Xcode loaded and up-to-date on campus are in a room
that I cannot access myself, but need someone to let me in. If I can access the room again 
before the due date, I will add features such as colors, tab splitting options, animations, and 
added settings.
